# Peer-graded Assignment: Course HTML CSS in depth

By working through the lessons in this course, you have learned the necessary skills and knowledge to develop a home page for a fictional client.

Using your new knowledge of HTML and CSS you need to create a semantic structure with a header, main content and footer. Decide between a grid or flexbox for your layout. The client’s logo needs to be in the header and the main content needs to have a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images below it. The footer should have two columns. The first column must contain a smaller version of the logo and the second column should have copywriting information.

In terms of styling, you should use your creativity to create the appropriate look and feel to capture the attention of the client’s target audience. You should use your knowledge about CSS selectors and effects to create the appropriate intentional engagement that would serve your client best.
